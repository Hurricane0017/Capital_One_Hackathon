### **Direct Answer**  
**Yes, irrigate your cotton crop between August 20–22.** Avoid irrigation on August 18–19 due to high wind speeds increasing evaporation loss. Soil moisture (0.40–0.41) is borderline for cotton at this stage (likely flowering/boll development), and zero rainfall forecast demands intervention.

---

### **Irrigation Recommendations**  
- **When & How Much**:  
  - **August 20–22**: Irrigate deeply (6–7 cm water depth) early morning (5–8 AM) to minimize evaporation.
