Based on the expert analysis of your cotton field conditions and the upcoming weather, here is the consolidated recommendation:

**1. Direct Answer:**  
**Yes, you should irrigate your cotton crop within the next 2 days (ideally within 48 hours).** Waiting the full 5 days risks significant stress and yield loss.

**2. Key Recommendations:**  
*   **Apply 25-30mm (1.0-1.2 inches) of water.**  
*   **Use drip irrigation if available** for maximum efficiency and water savings.
