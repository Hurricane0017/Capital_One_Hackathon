# Kisan AI - Agentic AI System for Indian Farmers

🌾 **Winner-focused AI system for agricultural decision support**

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Agentic AI system designed to help Indian farmers make informed decisions about irrigation, harvesting, pest control, crop selection, and government schemes. The system uses multiple specialized AI agents working together to provide accurate, localized agricultural advice.

## System Architecture

```
Farmer Input (Voice/Text) → Agent Orchestrator → Multiple Specialized Agents → LLM Processing → Actionable Response
```

### Core Components

2. **Weather Agent** - Handles weather-related queries and forecasts
3. **Database Agent** - Manages soil, pest, and insurance scheme data
4. **Farmer Input Agent** - Processes farmer profiles and context
5. **IVR Interface** - Connects with voice systems
6. **API Server** - REST endpoints for system integration

## Features

✅ **Multi-modal Support**: Voice, text, and structured data input  
✅ **Localized Weather Data**: Real-time weather analysis for farming decisions  
✅ **Comprehensive Database**: Soil types, pest profiles, government schemes  
✅ **Hindi/English Support**: Natural language processing in farmer-friendly language  
✅ **Context Awareness**: Maintains farmer profiles and conversation history  
✅ **High Accuracy**: Multiple data sources for reliable recommendations  
✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for millions of farmers

## Development Workflow

### 1. Agent Development
```python
# Example: Adding a new agent
from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class MarketAgent(BaseAgent):
    def process_query(self, query, context):
        # Market analysis logic
        pass
```

### 2. Testing
```bash
# Run specific agent tests
python -m pytest tests/test_weather_agent.py
