  "description": "The most dreaded pest of Arabica coffee in India with 100 years of research history. Larvae bore into coffee stems creating galleries, causing plant death and significant economic losses. More prevalent in Arabica than Robusta coffee, making India unique among coffee-producing countries.",

  "identification": {
    "physical_signs": [
      "Circular exit holes (4-6mm diameter) on coffee stems",
      "Boring dust and frass around entry/exit points",

      "Swelling or galls on affected stems",
      "Complete plant death in severe cases",
      "Adult beetles (15-20mm long) with white markings on black body"
