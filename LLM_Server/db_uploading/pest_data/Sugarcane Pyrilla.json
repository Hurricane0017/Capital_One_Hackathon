  "description": "A serious sap-sucking pest of sugarcane in northern India that occurs in epidemic outbreaks every 5-6 years. Both adults and nymphs suck phloem sap from leaves, secrete honeydew causing sooty mold, and reduce sugar content by up to 30%.",

      "Straw-colored bugs with projecting rostrum",
