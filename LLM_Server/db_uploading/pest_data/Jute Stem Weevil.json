  "description": "A small but highly destructive weevil pest of jute that causes significant fiber quality degradation. The female makes multiple oviposition holes in stems, causing fiber breakage and producing 'knotty fiber' that affects both quality and quantity, with up to 18% yield losses.",

      "Induced branching due to growth check",
