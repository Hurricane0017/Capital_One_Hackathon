  "description": "A major wheat pest also known as oriental armyworm that causes voracious defoliation. Larvae feed gregariously and can completely denude fields within days, causing up to 44% yield loss. It is a migratory pest that spreads along wind currents.",

      "Greenish-brown larvae with distinctive stripes",
      "Adults are greyish-yellow moths with dark markings"
